In Next.js 15, the introduction of the App Router and its concurrent rendering capabilities can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful about data fetching and state management.  A common, yet subtle, issue arises when using `async/await` within `getServerSideProps` or other data fetching functions in conjunction with client-side interactions.  If your asynchronous operation in `getServerSideProps` takes longer than expected and a client-side action (e.g., a button click triggering a route change) happens before it completes, the client-side interaction might render its results prematurely, before `getServerSideProps` has fully resolved.  This can result in stale data being displayed.  Another problem is race conditions in concurrent fetches.
